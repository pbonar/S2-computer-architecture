# Computer Architecture Concepts and Tic-Tac-Toe in MIPS

This project combines the implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using MIPS assembly language with concepts of computer architecture. It serves as a practical exploration of both game logic and low-level programming, demonstrating how architectural principles can be applied in a simple game scenario.

## Features

- **MIPS Assembly Implementation**:
  - Complete game logic for Tic-Tac-Toe allowing two players to compete.
  - Input handling for player moves and game state display.
  - Win condition checks and draw scenarios.

- **Computer Architecture Concepts**:
  - Exploration of MIPS instruction set, assembly language programming, and Logisim simulations.
  - Discussion on the underlying architecture of the MIPS processor used for execution.
  - Implementation of data structures for the game board within MIPS constraints.
  - Logisim circuit designs that visualize the architecture of the MIPS processor and its components as related to the game logic.

## Requirements

- MIPS assembler (e.g., MARS or SPIM)
- Logisim (for circuit simulations)
